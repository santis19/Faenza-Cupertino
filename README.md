# Faenza Cupertino

Just a fork of [this](https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Faenza-Cupertino?content=129008) theme.

You need Faenza installed for this to work.

Feel free to change the index.theme in case you want to use any other
Faenza style (Dark, Darkest, etc).

Changelog
---------
* Reboot icon now shows correctly in the Xfce 4.12 logout dialog.
